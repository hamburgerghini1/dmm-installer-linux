# Diva Mod Manager Installer for Linux
Installs Diva Mod Manager and its one click installer url handler.

Forked this because I had some problems with wine version check on my debian sid system

## Dependencies

### Steam Deck and Immutable Distros
Use the immutable script instead.  
Make sure AppImageLauncher is not installed.

### Arch
```
curl
wine
winetricks
unzip
desktop-file-utils
lib32-gnutls
lib32-gst-plugins-base
```
Install your dependencies with the following
```
sudo pacman -S curl wine winetricks p7zip unzip desktop-file-utils lib32-gnutls lib32-gst-plugins-base
```
If wine is "missing" from the repositories, open /etc/pacman.conf in your favorite editor and uncomment the two multilib (not multililb testing lines!) close to the endo f the file.  

### Debian and similar
```
curl
wine
winetricks
unzip
desktop-file-utils
gnutls
```

Install
```
sudo apt install curl wine winetricks p7zip unzip desktop-file-utils gnutls
```

Make sure you have these installed before trying to run the script otherwise you will run into issues.
